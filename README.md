# FlipKart Mobile Phone Prices Analysis and Machine Learning

This project focuses on extracting and analyzing mobile phone data from FlipKart, utilizing web scraping techniques and machine learning algorithms. By leveraging Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Request, the data is collected and processed for comprehensive analysis.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Data Collection:** The project initiates with data extraction from FlipKart utilizing BeautifulSoup and Request libraries, ensuring a systematic retrieval of mobile phone attributes.
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Analysis:** Subsequently, the dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning and analysis within MSSQL server, employing advanced techniques and aggregate functions to refine the data quality and glean meaningful insights.
   
3. **Visualization:** The cleaned dataset is seamlessly integrated into Power BI for intuitive visualization, facilitating the exploration of feature importance and data relationships through interactive visualizations.
   
4. **Further Analysis and Machine Learning:** Further analysis is conducted in Python environment using Google Colab and Google Drive. This phase encompasses extensive preprocessing steps such as handling null values and extracting pertinent information. Statistical analysis, including Descriptive, Inferential, and Hypothesis testing, is performed utilizing Pandas, Numpy, Math, and Scipy libraries. Machine learning models, ranging from traditional algorithms like Linear Regression and SVM to ensemble methods like XGBoost and AdaBoost, are developed using Scikit Learn. Deep learning models, including ANN, are also explored using Tensorflow and Keras frameworks. The top-performing model, XGBoost, achieves an impressive accuracy of 87%.
